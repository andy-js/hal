      This document concerns the specification of HAL which is a piece of
      software that provides a view of the various hardware attached to
      a system. Though the name HAL is derived from Hardware Abstraction
      Layer, HAL in itself is not an abstraction layer in the traditional
      sense. The purpose of HAL is to give an up to date view of hardware,
      merge arbitrary metadata with metadata obtained from the hardware
      and provide hooks such that system-level and desktop session-level
      software can react to changes in the hardware configuration in order
      to maintain system policy.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      A device, in the context of the HAL, is identified by a unique
      id and a set of properties (key/value pairs).  This document
      specifies a set of known properties and gives them well-defined
      meaning. This enables applications and desktop environments to
      make a distinction between the different device objects and use
      the devices based on certain well-known properties.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      For instance, the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>info.category</I
> property
      specifies what the device is (such as a digital camera or an
      audio device), and the
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>block.mount_point</I
> property
      specifies where in the filesystem a storage device is mounted. 
      In addition, the HAL provides generic device operations such as
      locking devices for exclusive access, or suspend/resume.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      In order to merge arbitrary metadata, HAL is concerned with so called 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device information files</I
>.

      A device information file matches a subset of devices (from
      properties derived from the physical bus the device is on or
      what functionality the underlying kernel provides) and populates
      them with other, often well-defined, properties.

      Device information files are by no means a substitute for driver
      software, they are simply hints to the desktop environment /
      applications about what the device is, what it does and how it
      can be used. For example, a device information file can be used
      to specify that what the kernel sees only as a USB Mass Storage
      Device is in fact a digital camera or a MP3 player.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      The HAL is built upon D-BUS which is an IPC framework that, among
      other things, provides a system-wide message-bus that allows
      applications to talk to one another. Apart from D-BUS, HAL has
      no other major dependencies which, in theory, allows it to work
      on many UNIX-like systems. The major focus, initially, is
      systems running the Linux 2.6 kernel.

>HAL daemon</I
></P
><P
> 

          A system-wide daemon that maintains a persistent database of
          device objects. It is also responsible for merging
          information from the device info file repository and
          managing the life cycle of device objects. The HAL daemon
          also contains detection and monitoring code for standard
          busses (PCI, USB etc.) and devices. The HAL daemon notifies
	  system level components through callouts and session level
	  components using the D-BUS interface.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>HAL agents</I
></P
><P
> 

          The term <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>HAL agent</I
> is used to
          characterize programs that is involved in the detection and
          monitoring of devices not supported directly by the HAL
          daemon.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
          Any program can be a HAL agent; all it means is that the
          program communicates with the HAL daemon using a specific
          interface.  Examples of use that come to mind are prototypes
          for supporting vendor or OEM specific busses/devices,
          integration of existing device detection/monitoring
          frameworks etc.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Applications</I
></P
><P
> 

          This represents the end consumers of the HAL and comprises
          both applications that need to search for a device, but also
          (existing) device specific libraries and/or services that
          provide operations on devices. Specifically, the application
          or device library obtain the ''address'', (the special
          device file or other details) of the device through HAL but
          interact with the device through the kernel as normal.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
          In addition, this group include desktop environments such as
          GNOME or KDE. Specifically, using HAL, desktop environments
          may include session-daemons enforcing certain policies when
          the device database managed by the HAL daemon changes.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
          Such policies may include starting a photo management
          application when a camera is plugged in, assisting the user in
          finding driver software and device information files for a
          new device, displaying link information about network
          devices, mounting removable storage and so on.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Callouts</I
></P
><P
> 

	  Callouts are invoked just after the HAL daemon have detected
	  a device, but just before desktop session level applications
	  are notified through the D-BUS interface. As such, callouts
	  can be used to maintain system-wide policy (that may be
	  specific to the particular OS) such as changing permissions
	  on device nodes, updating the systemwide /etc/fstab file or
	  configuring the networking subsystem.

        </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;
      The HAL uses D-BUS to provide a ''network API'' to both desktop
      applications and the aforementioned HAL agents. As D-BUS is
      designed to be language independent, potentially many languages
      / runtime systems will be able to easily access the services
      offered by HAL.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      It is important to emphasize that both the HAL daemon and
      programs acting as HAL agents are responsible for both
      adding/creating device objects and monitoring devices. Examples
      of monitoring includes network device link detection, optical
      disc change detection, storage volume mount point detection etc.
      This is detailed in the following sections.

><P
>&#13;      
      This section attempts to draw some line in the sand in terms of
      what HAL is supposed to do and not to do. First of all, HAL is
      concerned with

      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Maintaining a live list of device objects that correspond to
        the list maintained by the operating system kernel. This
        include bus specific information such as the PCI slot location
	or USB Vendor ID.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Merging class device information (derived from the hardware)
        into a device object.  For example, for a USB mouse HAL will
        merge well-defined properties describing the input-related
        capabilities of the mouse (e.g. how many buttons), and for
	optical discs HAL will merge information about the disc (e.g.
	is it a CD-R, DVD-RW etc.).

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Merging information (produced by human beings) into a device
        from device information files.  This allows applications to
        think in terms of ''capabilities'' rather than relying on
        device class information derived from the hardware. For example,
	for an MP3 player, the set of audio formats that the device is
	capable to playback can be merged.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Provide monitoring of detected devices in a way that doesn't
	disrupt normal device usage.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Provide ways for OS vendors to configure the operating system
	when new devices are detected by taking advantage of the metadata
	exported by HAL.

        </P
></LI

>&#13;
        Providing a simple to use query/notification API for use in
        desktop applications.

      HAL is not concerned with

      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Device configuration; that is the task of loading an operating
        system driver, uploading firmware, mounting a disk or
        configure/initiate a network connection.  It should be noted,
        though, that HAL provides excellent infrastructure, callouts
        and D-BUS notifications, for doing some of these tasks.

>&#13;
        Providing device-specific operations such as extracting
        pictures from a digital camera.  There already exists
        libraries and frameworks for dealing with hardware. The
        idea is to integrate HAL into already existing libraries/
	frameworks/applications.

        </P
></LI
></UL

      Specifically, HAL doesn't enforce any policy whatsoever, this
      is left for desktop environments and operating systems vendors to
      implement. See section TODO for further discussion.

      It is important to precisely define the term ''HAL device
      object'' - it is actually intended to mean two things:

      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        A device as recognized by the USB, PCI etc. standards and treated as
        such by the operating system kernel and base OS.

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;
        Storage volumes (e.g. partitions on a storage device), optical
	discs and other first class objects in UNIX-like operating
	systems. While partitions are not real devices (they lend
	space on a real device such as a hard disk or an optical
	disc), they are on the same conceptual level as hard disks or
	optical discs.

        </P
></LI
></UL
>

      Note there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between
      physical devices attached to a computer system and ''device
      objects''.  A multi-function device, which appears (and is
      marketed) to users as a multi-function printer may show up as
      several device objects; e.g.  printer, scanner, fax and storage.
      On the other hand, PCI networking equipment with multiple ports
      may show up as several networking devices and so on.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      HAL is not concerned with this duality of either one-to-one or
      many-to-one relationships between ''device objects'' and the actual iron
      constituting what users normally understand as a single device.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      A device object consist of the following information

      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;
          <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Unique Device ID (referred to as the UDI in the 
          following)</I
></P
><P
> 

          This is an identifier that is unique for a device object - that
          is, no other device object can have the same UDI at the same time.
          The UDI is computed from bus-specific information so it is unique
          across device insertions and when multiple instances of the same
          kind of device is plugged in. It is also independent of the 
	  physical slot the device is plugged into.

          Each device got a set of properties which are key/value pairs.

></LI
></UL
>

      The first category is determined by HAL, the next is merged from
      either the hardware itself or device information files and the
      last is intercepted by monitoring the operating system.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      This specification is concerned with precisely defining several
      properties; see <A

> and onwards
      for more information.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      As a complement to device properties, HAL also provides 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>conditions</I
> on HAL device objects. Conditions
      are used to relay events that are happening on devices which are
      not easily expressed in properties. This includes events such as
      ''processor is overheating'' or ''block device unmounted''.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      The fundamental idea about HAL is that all ''interesting'' information
      about hardware a desktop application needs can be obtained by HAL.

      </P

      The HAL daemon is a system-wide process that keeps track of a
      number of device objects. It communicates with the operating
      system and intercepts hotplug events as devices are plugged in
      and removed.  The daemon is also responsible for providing
      services to applications that wants to locate devices and
      perform generic operations them such as obtaining exclusive
      access.  Non-generic operations, such as obtaining pictures from
      a camera device, is outside the scope of the HAL daemon; see
      <A
HREF="#using-devices"

>Using devices</I
></A

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      HAL has the concept of device stores. When a device is detected
      it is placed in the TDL (temporary device list) and then properties
      are merged from several sources including device information files
      and possibly callouts. Eventually, the device transitions to the
      GDL (global device list) and first then it becomes ''visible'' for 
      desktop applications.

>&#13;    One of the goals of the HAL is to provide easy access to devices on
    a system. This includes obtaining device specific information, such
    as CPU frequency, and invoking device specific methods such as
    getting the pictures on a camera or changing the volume on a sound
    device.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
    While the HAL daemon provides generic operations that apply to all
    devices (though some may be no-ops) and provide some level of monitoring
    for well-know class devices (such as networking devices), it is not
    concerned with providing non-generic device operations. 

    </P
><P
>&#13;
    The architecture of the HAL allows a number of ways of dealing with
    specific device information and operations

    <P

><LI
><P
>&#13;        <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Out-of-process D-BUS Service</I
></P
><P
> 
        For example, one could write a volume manager that manages the
        different storage devices present on the system and mount the
        partitions/volumes available on those into the filesystem 
        according to certain rules. 
        The volume manager would run as a daemon monitoring the device list
        of the HAL daemon and act appropriately when devices having 
        Storage and StorageVolume in the Capabilitites property appear and
        disappear. 

        </P
><P
>&#13;
        The volume manager could also offer an operation for writing
        ISO images to e.g. CD-R devices through a D-BUS interface
        on HAL device object. In this scenario, a desktop file manager
        would use the HAL daemon to query for the HAL device object
        that is a CD recorder and pass the object reference to the
        D-BUS service offered by the volume manager.
      </P

CLASS="emphasis"

><P
> 

        Another example is device objects having capability
        camera. One could use an existing library, such as libgphoto2,
        and make wrapper functions such that the application
        programmer simple passes the HAL UDI to the library. The
        library would then, via D-BUS, acquire the bus-specific
        information required from the HAL daemon, and then interact
        with the device.

      </P
></LI
></UL
>

    Note that there are other ways of dealing with device-specific
    operations - this list is not exhaustive.

CLASS="sect1"

NAME="capabilties"
>Capabilities</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
     As previously mentioned the capabilities of a device specify what
     the device does. For instance, a CompactFlash card reader can be
     thought of as a camera, a handheld music device and removable
     storage.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
     HAL itself, assigns capabilities on device detection time by
     inspecting the device class (if available, it depends on the bus
     type) and looking at information from the operating system (most
     OS'es has a concept of device classes). At this time the category
     is also determined by selecting the most prominent
     capability. However, both capabilities and category can be
     overridden by either device information files or a desktop
     environment policy daemon. This gives maximum flexibility, while
     maintaining a base level of capability detection. 

     </P
><P
>&#13;
     Note that, for instance, a number of USB devices doesn't advertise
     anything in their device class, so a repository of device
     information files coupled with an interactive dialog (provided by a
     desktop environment daemon) asking the user what he just plugged
     in, will probably yield the best experience for users. Incidently,
     this is how certain non-free operating systems appear to handle
     hardware.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
     Returning to the example of the card reader, this might just
     happen to be a digital camera with the only interface being a
     card reader - HAL, or the base OS, wouldn't be able to tell the
     difference - it's just looks like a storage device. So, to handle
     hardware well to meet the expectation of the users, device
     information files and desktop environment policy daemons need to
     be available on top of HAL (notably, the desktop environment
     daemon might look at the files on the device to infer whether
     it's music, pictures or something else) and adjust the capabilities
     and category of certain devices.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
     Finally, what a given capability means, needs to be precisely
     defined. The idea of HAL is that existing device capability
     specific libraries (such as libghoto2), would advertise what kind
     of HAL capabilities they are able to handle. As this happens over
     time, this specification will grow to precisely define what a
     device with a given capability is supposed to do and what
     library, or service, the application programmer can use to access
     the device. At some point in time, we may define an uniform
     in-process extension framework akin to e.g. OpenGL extensions for
     accessing said libraries and services.
     
     </P
><P
>&#13;
     Having a capability also means that part of the property
     namespace, prefixed with the capability name, can (but it's not a
     requirement) be populated with more specific information about
     the capability. Virtual devices will not have any capabilities
     assigned to them.

     </P
><P

     The following table define the capabilities supported in HAL at
     the time of writing.

     As evident, most of the capabilities in the above list is derived
     directly from USB and PCI classes (the careful reader will even
     note that not all classes from the USB and PCI standards are
     mentioned), and as such, are not very interesting to desktop
     applications.

      The info.parent property is very significant - for example, it's
      what allows applications to associate a volume with a
      device. Consider the following setup of devices

      </P
><P
>&#13;        <IMG
SRC="hal-volume-to-device.png">
      </P
><P
>&#13;
      Now, the ''CF Reader'' USB device is an ancestor to the the
      volume that has highlight. Desktop environments can detect this
      by traversing from the volume device through parents to find the
      USB device and either merge more information (such as the
      capability camera) into the USB device object or extract the
      capability (a device information file might have merged the
      capability camera) and act accordingly. Optionally, the DE can
      make the USB device persistent by setting the property
      info.persistent to true.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      Indeed, this very use-case is one of the reasons that HAL tracks
      information about volumes (FIXME: HAL should, in a later version,
      directly support a property in info. that points to the actual
      device).

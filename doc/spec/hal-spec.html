	  IntroductionAbout
	This document concerns the specification of HAL which is a
	piece of software that provides a view of the various hardware
	attached to a system. In addition to this, HAL keeps detailed
	metadata for each piece of hardware and provide hooks such
	that system- and desktop-level software can react to changes
	in the hardware configuration in order to maintain system
	policy.

      

	HAL represents a piece of hardware as a 
	device object. A device object is
	identified by a unique identifer and carries a set of
	key/value paris referred to as device
	properties. Some properties are derived from the
	actual hardware, some are merged from device
	information files and some are related to the
	actual device configuration. This document specifies the set
	of device properties and gives them well-defined meaning. This
	enable system and desktop level components to distinguish
	between the different device objects and discover and
	configure devices based on these properties.

      
	
	HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-BUS which is an IPC
	framework that, among other things, provides a system-wide
	message-bus that allows applications to talk to one
	another. Specifically, D-BUS provides asynchronous
	notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the
	message-bus when devices are added and removed as well as when
	properties on a device are changing.  

      

	The most important goal of HAL is to provide plug-and-play
	facilities for UNIX-like desktops with focus on providing a
	rich and extensible description of device characteristics and
	features. HAL has no other major dependencies apart from D-BUS
	which, given sufficient infrastructure, allows it to be
	implemented on many UNIX-like systems. The major focus,
	initially, is systems running the Linux 2.6 series kernels.

      OverviewArchitecture of HAL

      The HAL consists of a number of components as outlined in the
      diagram below. Note that this diagram is high-level and doesn't
      capture implementation details.

    
      
    

      Details on each component

      
          HAL daemon 

          A system-wide daemon that maintains a persistent database of
          device objects. The daemon is also responsible for merging
          information from the device information file repository and
          managing the life cycle of device objects. The HAL daemon
          also contains detection and monitoring code for
          buses (such as PCI and USB buses) and devices (such as
          networking and storage devices). The HAL daemon notifies system
          level components through callouts and session level
          components using the D-BUS interface.

        
          Applications 

            This represents the end consumers of the HAL and comprises
            both applications that need to search for a device, but
            also (existing) device specific libraries and/or services
            that provide access to devices. Specifically, the
            application or device library can obtain the ''address''
            (the special device file or other details), of the device
            through HAL, to interact with the device through the
            kernel as usual.

          

            In addition, this group include desktop environments such
            as GNOME or KDE. Specifically, using HAL, desktop
            environments may include session-level daemons enforcing
            certain policies when the device database managed by the
            HAL daemon changes. Such policies may include starting a
            photo management application when a camera is plugged in,
            assisting the user in finding driver software and device
            information files for a new device, displaying link status
            information about network devices, mounting removable
            storage and so on.

          

	    Note that several desktop sessions may be active on the
	    same system; it is the responsibility of session-level
	    software to arbitrate the device access between sessions.

        
          Callouts 

	    Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list
	    is modified  As such, callouts can be used to maintain 
	    system-wide policy (that may be specific to the particular 
	    OS) such as changing permissions on device nodes, updating 
	    the systemwide /etc/fstab file or
	    configuring the networking subsystem.

        
      

      The HAL uses D-BUS to provide a ''network API'' to
      applications. As D-BUS is designed to be language independent,
      potentially many languages / runtime systems will be able to
      easily access the services offered by HAL. The D-BUS API is
      detailed in . Note that HAL doesn't
      enforce any policy at all, this is left for desktop environments
      and operating systems vendors to implement.  However, to ensure
      interoperability between operating systems and desktop
      environments, recommendations and best practises on how to
      enforce policy is discussed in .

    HAL on Linux 2.6

      On a Linux 2.6 system HAL is implemented as shown in the diagram
      below:

      
	
      

      Highlights

      
	    HAL depends on the udev and 
	    linux-hotplug packages
        
	    The diagram shows an example callout program, 
	    fstab-sync, that creates/destroys
	    mount points and modifies the /etc/fstab
	    file accordingly whenever storage devices are added or
	    removed.
        
	    A session-level daemon, *-volume-manager,
	    for mounting storage devices is shown. This piece of software
	    depends on a properly updated /etc/fstab
	    file and a setuid mount(1) binary that 
	    allows an unprivileged user to mount devices marked with option
	    user in the /etc/fstab file.
        
	    The fstab-sync and 
	    *-volume-manager programs are only
	    examples on how to enforce policy and are not part of HAL
	    proper.  An OS vendor may choose to enforce policy in a
	    different way e.g. he might want to ignore the 
	    /etc/fstab file and mount storage volumes
	    in the callout, run a daemon with sufficient privileges
	    or use another setuid mount wrapper.
	    See  for more details.
        

    Device Objects

	It is important to precisely define the term HAL device
	object. It's actually a bit blurry to define in general, it
	includes what most UNIX-like systems consider first class
	objects when it comes to hardware. In particular, a device
	object should represent the smallest unit of addressable
	hardware. This means there can be a one-to-many relationship
	between a physical device and the device objects exported by
	HAL. Specifically, a multi-function printer, which appear to
	users as a single device may show up as several device
	objects; e.g. one HAL device object for each of the printing,
	scanning, fax and storage interfaces. Conversely, some devices
	may be implemented such that the HAL device object represent
	several functional interfaces. HAL is not concerned with this
	duality of either one-to-many or many-to-one relationships
	between device objects and the actual iron constituting what
	users normally understand as a single piece of hardware;
	a device object represents the smallest addressable unit.

      

	Device objects in HAL are organised on a by-connection basis,
	e.g. for a given device object X it is possible to find the
	device object Y where X is attached to Y. This gives structure
	to the device database of HAL; it is possible to map the
	devices out in a tree. Further, software emulation devices
	exported by a kernel, such as SCSI emulation for USB Storage
	Devices, are also considered device objects in HAL. This
	implies that kernel specific bits leak into the device object
	database. However users of HAL won't notice, such device
	objects are not referenced anywhere in the device objects that
	users are interested in; they are merely used as glue to build
	the device tree.

      

	In addition to provide information about what kind of hardware
	a device object represents (such as a PCI or USB device) and
	how to address it, HAL merges information about the functional
	interfaces the OS kernel provides in order to use the device;
	in most cases this is represented on the device object as a
	string property with the name of the special device file in
	/dev. In addition to the special device
	file, a number of other useful properties are merged. This
	means that both hardware and functional properties are on the
	same device object, which is very useful for an application
	programmer. For example, an application might query HAL for
	the device object that exports the special device file
	/dev/input/mouse2 and learn that this is
	provide by an USB mouse from a certain manufacturer by
	checking the properties that export the USB vendor and product
	identifiers.  See  and
	 for details.

      

	On a formal level, a device object is comprised by

      

          UDI 

          This is an identifier, the Unique Device Identifer, that is
          unique for a device object - that is, no other device object
          can have the same UDI at the same time.  The UDI is computed
          using bus-specific information and is meant to be unique
          across device insertions and independent of the physical
          port or slot the device may be plugged into.

        

          Properties 

          Each device object got a set of properties which are
          key/value pairs.  The key is an ASCII string while the value
          can be one of several types

          string - 
		UTF8 stringstrlist - 
		sorted list with UTF8 stringsint - 
		32-bit signed integeruint64 - 
		64-bit unsigned integerbool - 
		truth valuedouble - 
		IEEE754 double precision floating point number

        
	Properties of a device object carry all the important
	information about a device object. For organisational reasons
	properties are also namespaced using ''.'' as a separator.
	
      

	It can be useful to classify properties into four groups

      Metadata - Information about how the devices
	                are connected with respect to each other
	                (parent/child relationships), what kind of
	                device it is, what functionality it provides
	                etc.
	Facts - 
                        vendor ID, product ID, disk serial numbers, 
	                number of buttons on a mouse, formats accepted
	                by a mp3 player and so on.Usage specific information - 
	                Network link status, special device file name, 
                        filesystem mount location etc.Policy - 
                        How the device is to be used be users; usually
	                defined by the system administrator.

	The first category is determined by HAL, the next is merged
	from either the hardware itself or device information files,
	the third is intercepted by monitoring the operating system
	and the last is merged from files that only the system
	administrator can edit. This specification is concerned with
	precisely defining several properties; see  and onwards for more
	information.  As a complement to device properties, HAL also
	provides conditions on HAL device
	objects. Conditions are used to relay events that are
	happening on devices which are not easily expressed in
	properties. This includes events such as ''processor is
	overheating'' or ''block device unmounted''.

      

	There is a special hal device object referred to as the ''root
	computer device object''. This device object represent the
	entire system as a whole and all other devices are either
	directly or indirectly childs of this device object. It has
	the
	UDI /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer.

      

	The fundamental idea about HAL is that all ''interesting''
	information about hardware that a desktop application needs,
	can be obtained by querying HAL. Below is a screenshot of a
	simple device manager application shipped with HAL
	called hal-device-manager.  This
	application is communicating with the HAL daemon and displays
	the tree of device objects. The shown properties are for a
	device object representing a harddisk.
      
        
      

      Device Capabilities

       Mainstream hardware isn't very good at reporting what they are,
       they only report, at best, how to interact with them. This is a
       problem; many devices, such as MP3 players or digital still
       cameras, appear to the operating system as plain USB Mass
       Storage devices when they in fact are a lot more than just
       that. The core of the problem is that without external
       metadata, the operating system and desktop environment will
       present it to the user as just e.g. a mass storage device.

     

       As HAL is concerned with merging of external metadata, through
       e.g. device information files, there needs to be some scheme on
       how to record what the device actually is. This is achieved by
       two textual properties, info.category and
       info.capabilities. The former describes
       what the device is (as a single
       alphanumeric keyword) and the latter describes
       what the device does (as a number of
       alphanumeric keywords separated by whitespace). The keywords
       available for use is defined in this document; we'll refer to
       them in following simply as capabilities.

     

       HAL itself, assigns capabilities on device detection time by
       inspecting the device class (if available, it depends on the
       bus type) and looking at information from the operating system
       (most OS'es have a concept of device classes). At this time the
       category is also determined by selecting the most prominent
       capability. However, both capabilities and category can be
       overridden by either device information files or callouts. This
       gives maximum flexibility, while maintaining a base level of
       capability detection.

     

       The idea of HAL is that existing device capability specific
       libraries (such as libghoto2), would advertise what kind of HAL
       capabilities they are able to handle. As this happens over
       time, this specification will grow to precisely define what a
       device with a given capability is supposed to do and what
       library, or service, the application programmer can use to
       access the device.
     
     

       Having a capability also means that part of the property
       namespace, prefixed with the capability name, will be populated
       with more specific information about the capability. Indeed,
       some properties may even be required such that applications and
       device libraries have something to expect. For instance, the
       capability for being a MP3 player may require properties
       defining what audio formats the device support, whether it
       support recording of audio, and how to interact with the
       device. For example, the latter may specify ''USB Storage
       Device'' or ''proprietary protocol, use libfooplayer''.

     

       Just as device objects can appear and disappear at any time
       (e.g. when a device is plugged in respectively removed),
       capabilities can also appear and disappear - one example of
       this happening is when device drivers are loaded and unloaded.

     

       Finally, capabilities have an inheritance scheme, e.g. if a device
       has a capability foo.bar, it must also have
       the capability foo.

     Using devices

      While the HAL daemon provides generic operations that apply to
      all devices (though some may be no-ops), HAL is not concerned
      with providing non-generic device operations. Specifically, one
      goal of HAL is to integrate with existing and future libraries
      that target a specific class of devices such as cameras or mp3
      players.

    

      For instance, libgphoto2 could be extended
      such that the application programmer can simply pass the UDI of
      the camera he wishes to interact with
      and libghoto2 would then, via D-BUS, acquire
      the bus-specific information required, the address so to speak,
      from the HAL daemon, and then interact directly with the
      hardware.

    

      Another option is to use the existing API of the device library
      to discover devices (the library would be using HAL under the
      hood) and provide a function to retrieve the HAL UDI of the
      device. When the library is built without HAL support this
      function returns NULL, however, when the UDI
      is available, then applications using the library can use the
      UDI both as stable reference to the device and also to extract
      more information directly from the HAL daemon.

    Device Properties
      Properties are arranged in a namespaces using ''.'' as a separator
      and are key/value pairs. The value may assume different types; currently
      int32, double, bool, UTF8 strings and UTF8 string lists are supported. 
      The key of a property is always an ASCII string without any whitespace. 
      The properties are updated in real-time.
    Metadata Properties

	The section represents properties that aren't tied to either
	physical or functional characteristics of what the device
	object represents.

      info namespace

      The info namespace contain properties that
      can be considered metadata about device objects. These
      properties are always available.

      Physical Properties

	In this section properties for device objects that represent
	physically addressable hardware is described. Availability of
	these depends on the value of the info.bus
	property.  These properties are not of particular interest to
	application developers, instead they are useful for libraries
	and userspace drivers that needs to interact with the device
	given a UDI. Knowledge of various bus interconnect
	technologies is assumed for this section to be useful.

      pci namespace

	This namespace contains properties for device objects representing
	functions on devices on a PCI bus. These properties are available
	exactly when info.bus equals pci.

	      Functional Properties

	The section describe functional properties of device objects,
	that is, properties that are merged onto device objects
	representing physically addressable hardware. In most
	circumstances such properties stem from a kernel level
	driver attached to the device represented by the device object,
	however, as HAL can merge properties from anywhere, they
	may have been merged from device information files or callouts.

      volume namespace

	This namespace is for device objects that represent storage
	devices with a filesystem that can be mounted. Such device
	objects will have the capability volume and
	they will export the properties below. Note that device
	objects can only have the volume capability
	if they already have the capability block
	and the property block.is_volume set to TRUE.

	This namespace is used to describe physical storage devices
	and their capabilities. Such device objects will have the 
	capability storage and
	they will export the properties below. Note that device
	objects can only have the storage capability
	if they already got capability block and the
	property block.is_volume set to FALSE.
	One significant between the storage and
	block namespace is that the properties
	exported in the storage represents
	constant vital product information, whereas the properties
	in the block namespace represent 
	variable system-dependent information.

		This property is a hint to programs that maintain the 
		/etc/fstab file to signal, when
		TRUE, that the storage drive (such as floppy or
		optical drives) is used for media with no partition
		table so an entry can be added ahead of media
		insertion time. Note that this is only a hint; media
		may be inserted that has partition tables that the
		kernel may respect. Conversely, when this is FALSE
		media without partition tables may be inserted (an
		example is a Compact Flash card; this media is normally
		formatted with a PC style partition table and a single
		FAT partition. However, it may be formatted with just
		a single FAT partition and no partition table).
	      storage.physical_device (string)Yes
		This contains the UDI of the device object
		representing the physical device or blank if 
		there is no such device (which is TRUE for legacy

		number of properties are merged from that device
		object. Specifically, all properties prefixed
		with storage and, if the physical
		device has several storage ports,
		storage_lunX (where X is number of
		the port starting from zero) are merged and will have 
		the prefix storage.  See  for an example.

	      Device Information Files

      Device information files (.fdi files is a
      shorthand) are used to merge arbitrary properties onto device
      objects. The way device information files works is that once all
      physical properties are merged onto a device object it is tried
      against the set of installed device information files.  Device
      information files are used for both merging facts and policy
      settings about devices.

    

      Each device information file got a number of
      &#60;match key="some_property"
      [string|int|bool|..]="required_value" &#62; directives
      that is tested against the properties of the device object. If
      all the match directives passes then the device information can
      include &#60;[merge|append|prepend] key="some_property"
      type="[string|int|bool|..]"&#62; directives to
      respectively merge new properties or append to existing
      properties on the device object. It's important to emphasize
      that any previously property stemming from device detection can
      be overridden by a device information file.

    

      The &#60;match&#62;, 
      &#60;merge&#62;, &#60;append&#62; 
      and &#60;prepend&#62; directives always requires
      the key attribute which must be either a
      property name on the device object in question or a path to a
      property on another device object. The latter case is expressed
      either through direct specification of the UDI, such as 
      /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer:foo.bar
      or indirect references such as 
      @info.parent:baz where the latter means that
      the device object specified by the UDI in the string property 
      info.parent should be used to query the
      property baz. It is also possible to use
      multiple indirections, e.g. for a volume on a USB memory stick
      the indirection @block.storage_device:@storage.physical_device:usb.vendor_id
      will reference the usb.vendor_id property
      on the device object representing the USB interface.

    

      When the property to match have been determined a number of
      attributes can be used within the &#60;match&#62;
      tag:
       
	     string - match a string property; for example
	     &#60;match key="foo.bar" string="baz"&#62;
	     will match only if 'foo.bar' is a string property assuming the value 'baz'.
	 
	     int - match an integer property
	 
	     uint64 - match property with the 64-bit unsigned type
	 
	     bool - match a boolean property
	 
	     double - match a property of type double
	 
	     exists - used as 
	     &#60;match key="foo.bar" exists="true"&#62;. Can be used with
	     'true' and 'false' respectively to match when a property exists and it doesn't.
	 
	     empty - can only be used on string properties with 'true' and 'false'. The semantics
	     for 'true' is to match only when the string is non-empty.
	 
	     is_absolute_path - matches only when a string property represents an absolute path
	     (the path doesn't have to exist). Can be used with 'true' or 'false'.
	 
	     is_ascii - matches only when a string property contain only ASCII characters. 
	     Can be used with 'true' or 'false'.
	 
	     compare_lt - can be used on int, uint64, double and string properties to compare
	     with a constant. Matches when the given property is less than the given constant
	     using the default ordering.
	 
	     compare_le - like compare_lt but matches when less than or equal.
	 
	     compare_gt - like compare_lt but matches when greater than.
	 
	     compare_ge - like compare_lt but matches when greater than or equal.
	 
	     contains - can only be used with string and strlist (string list). For a string key this
	     matches when the property contains the given (sub-)string. For a string list this match if the given 
	     string match a item of the list.
	 
	     contains_ncase - like contains but the property and the 
	     given key are converted to lowercase before check.
	 

       The &#60;merge&#62;, &#60;append&#62; 
       and &#60;prepend&#62; directives all require 
       the type attribute which specifies what to
       merge. The following values are supported

       
	     string - The value is copied to the property. For example
	     &#60;merge key="foo.bar" type="string"&#62;baz&#60;/merge&#62;
	     will merge the value 'baz' into the property 'foo.bar'.	     
	 
	     strlist - For &#60;merge&#62; the value is 
	     copied to the property and the current property will be overwritten. For 
	     &#60;append&#62; and &#60;prepend&#62; the 
	     value is append or prepend to the list as new item.
	 
	     bool - Can merge the values 'true' or 'false'
	 
	     int - Merges an integer
	 
	     uint64 - Merges an unsigned 64-bit integer
	 
	     double - Merges a double precision floating point number
	 
	     copy_property - Copies the value of a given property - supports paths with
	     direct and indirect UDI's. For example
	     &#60;merge key="foo.bar" type="copy_property"&#62;@info.parent:baz.bat&#60;/merge&#62;
	     will merge the value of the property baz.bat on the device object with the UDI from
	     the property info.parent into the property foo.bar on 
	     the device object being processed.
	 

       The &#60;remove&#62;, directive require only a key and can be used with all keys. 
       For strlist there is additionally a special syntax to remove a item from the 
       string list. For example to remove item 'bla' from property 'foo.bar':   
       &#60;remove key="foo.bar" type="strlist"&#62;bla&#60;/merge&#62;

       
       
	Device Information files are stored in the following standard hierachy with the following default
        top level directories information, policy and 
        preprobe:

	that the device information file targets:
	
      
	
      Policy settings for devices
	Policy settings specifies system specific settings that a
	system administrator associates with a device instance. In the
	context of hal, this can be expressed in terms of device
	properties merged on the device object in question. Default
	policy can also be merged on the root computer device object.
      Storage Devices

	Policy for storage devices is expressed in the 
	storage.policy.default, 
	storage.policy and
	volume.policy namespaces, see
	 for details.

      
	The default policy for storage devices shipped with hal looks like this
      
	
      
	and can be overridden by OS vendors to suit their purposes.
      
	Users can also customize their own rules; some examples follow	
      
	
      Callouts

      Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list is
      modified. As such, callouts can be used to maintain system-wide 
      policy (that may be specific to the particular OS) such as 
      changing permissions on device nodes, updating the systemwide 
      /etc/fstab file or configuring the networking 
      subsystem.
      
    
      
      There are three different classes of callouts. A callout
      involves sequentially invoking all executable programs in the
      string list in listed order.

    Key (type)ValuesMandatoryDescriptioninfo.callouts.add (string list)No
		A string list with all programmes/callouts which should be 
		executed (with HALD_ACTION=add) when the device 
		is added to the GDL (global device list) but just before it is 
		announced through the D-BUS network API.
	      info.callouts.remove (string list)No
		A string list with all programmes/callouts which should be 
		executed (with HALD_ACTION=remove) when the 
		device is removed from the GDL (global device list). The device 
		isn't removed before the last callout has finished. 
	      info.callouts.preprobe (string list)No
		A string list with all programmes/callouts which should be 
		executed (with HALD_ACTION=preprobe) before 
		the device is added to the GDL (global device list) and before 
		the callouts from info.callouts.add are executed.
	      
      
      All callouts execute in the same environment as which the HAL
      daemon was started. In addition, the UDI of the device object is
      exported in the environment variable UDI. All
      properties of the device object are exported in the environment
      prefixed with HAL_. If a device is added or
      removed is exported in the environment variable HALD_ACTION
      , if HAL is in shutdown mode the variable 
      HALD_SHUTDOWN is set to environment.
    
      
    
      The HAL daemon isn't suspended while callouts are executing. Thus, 
      callouts can communicate with the HAL daemon using the D-BUS network
      API. Hence, one application of callouts is to merge or modify
      properties on a device object.

    D-BUS Network API 

      The HAL daemon is a system-wide process that keeps track of a
      number of device objects. It communicates with the operating
      system and intercepts hotplug events as devices are plugged in
      and removed.  The daemon is also responsible for providing
      services to applications that wants to locate devices and
      perform generic operations on them such as obtaining exclusive
      access.  Non-generic operations, such as obtaining pictures from
      a camera device, is outside the scope of the HAL daemon; see
       for more information.

      

      HAL has the concept of device stores. When a device is detected
      it is placed in the TDL (temporary device list) and then properties
      are merged from several sources including device information files
      and possibly callouts. Eventually, the device transitions to the
      GDL (global device list) and first then it becomes ''visible'' for 
      desktop applications.

      Interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager 

      Using D-BUS terminology, the HAL daemon provides the D-BUS
      service org.freedesktop.Hal. This service
      offers a D-BUS object at a well-known
      location /org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager. This
      object offers a D-BUS
      interface, org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager, for
      querying device objects with the following methods:
      
# Return a list of all devices in the GDL
#
# @return                       List of UDI's
#
array{string} GetAllDevices()

# Determine if a device with a given Unique Device Id exists in the GDL
#
# @param  udi                   Device UDI, for example '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/pci_8086_7111'
# @return                       TRUE iff the device with the given UDI exists
#
bool DeviceExists(string udi)

# Find the set of devices in the GDL that has a given property matching
# a given value
#
# @param  key                   Key, for example 'block.fstype'
# @param  value                 Value, for example 'ext3'
# @return                       Array of UDI's, may be empty
#
array{string} FindDeviceStringMatch(string key, string value)

# Find the set of devices in the GDL that has a given capability
#
# @param  capability            Capability, for example 'volume'
# @return                       Array of UDI's, may be empty
#
array{string} FindDeviceByCapability(string capability)
  


      This object also emits the following signals on the
      /org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager object on the
      org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager interface that
      applications can subscribe to using D-BUS:

      

# Notification that a new device have been added to the GDL
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void DeviceAdded(string udi)

# Notification that a new device have been removed from the GDL. The
# application cannot use this UDI anymore.
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void DeviceRemoved(string udi)

# Notification that a device in the GDL have got a new capability. Note that
# this is emitted even though the device already had the old capability
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void NewCapability(string udi, string capability)

      org.freedesktop.Hal interface that applications can subscribe to 
      using D-BUS

      
# Notification that property have been modified
#
# @param  key                   Property
# @param  added                 True iff the property have been added
# @param  removed               True iff the property have been removed
#
void PropertyModified(string key, bool added, bool removed)

# Notification that an event happened on the device has occured.
#
# Normally this is used to signal events that aren't or can't be expressed
# in properties, e.g. 'ProcessorOverheating' etc. 
#
# @param  condition             Name of condition
# @param  ...                   Dependent on the condition name
void Condition(string condition, ...)



      Note that D-BUS supports that applications can opt to receive
      signals for only a subset of the devices available.

      Enforcing Policy 

      Notwithstanding the fact that HAL avoids to enforce any policy,
      it is useful to have a minimal set of guidelines such that
      applications using HAL written for one operating system can
      easily run on another. This chapter contains recommendations
      about how to enforce policy to achieve that goal.

    Storage DevicesPolicy for Volumes and Storage devices
	  The properties in the storage.policy, 
	  volume.policy and 
	  storage.policy.default namespaces should
	  be the preferred way to determine how and if a filesystem
	  can be mounted. See 
	  for details.
	File systems file
	  An operating system vendor should maintain the 
	  /etc/fstab file through the HAL callout
	  mechanism such that device objects of capability
	  volume and storage has
	  a corresponding entry if applicable cf. 
	  .
	
	  The reasoning behind this is, among other things, to
	  maintain the invariant that /etc/fstab
	  list all available filesystems. In addition
	  the mount(1) program should enable users
	  without superuser privileges to mount filesystems mentioned
	  in the /etc/fstab file as long as they
	  have the user option set.
	Disabling policy agents
	  Policy agents like volume mounters should ignore when media
	  is inserted into a drive that is locked by another
	  application. Thus, CD burning applications should lock the
	  device to disable auto mounting or automatic start of the
	  users preferred CD burning application when respectively
	  non-blank rewritable or blank media is inserted.

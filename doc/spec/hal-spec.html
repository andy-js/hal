          IntroductionAbout
      This document concerns the specification of HAL which is a
      piece of software that provides a view of the various hardware
      attached to a system. In addition to this, HAL keeps detailed
      metadata for each piece of hardware and provide hooks such
      that system- and desktop-level software can react to changes
      in the hardware configuration in order to maintain system
      policy.
    
      HAL represents a piece of hardware as a device object.
      A device object is identified by a unique identifer and carries a set of
      key/value paris referred to as device properties.
      Some properties are derived from the actual hardware, some are merged
      from device information files
      and some are related to the
      actual device configuration. This document specifies the set
      of device properties and gives them well-defined meaning. This
      enable system and desktop level components to distinguish
      between the different device objects and discover and
      configure devices based on these properties.
    
      HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-BUS which is an IPC
      framework that, among other things, provides a system-wide
      message-bus that allows applications to talk to one
      another. Specifically, D-BUS provides asynchronous
      notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the
      message-bus when devices are added and removed as well as when
      properties on a device are changing.
    
      The most important goal of HAL is to provide plug-and-play
      facilities for UNIX-like desktops with focus on providing a
      rich and extensible description of device characteristics and
      features. HAL has no other major dependencies apart from D-BUS
      which, given sufficient infrastructure, allows it to be
      implemented on many UNIX-like systems. The major focus,
      initially, is systems running the Linux 2.6 series kernels.

    Architecture of HAL
      The HAL consists of a number of components as outlined in the
      diagram below. Note that this diagram is high-level and doesn't
      capture implementation details.
    
      
    
      Details on each component
      
            HAL daemon
          
            A system-wide daemon that maintains a persistent database of
            device objects. The daemon is also responsible for merging
            information from the device information file repository and
            managing the life cycle of device objects. The HAL daemon
            also contains detection and monitoring code for
            buses (such as PCI and USB buses) and devices (such as
            networking and storage devices). The HAL daemon notifies system
            level components through callouts and session level
            components using the D-BUS interface.
          
            Applications
          
            This represents the end consumers of the HAL and comprises
            both applications that need to search for a device, but
            also (existing) device specific libraries and/or services
            that provide access to devices. Specifically, the
            application or device library can obtain the ''address''
            (the special device file or other details), of the device
            through HAL, to interact with the device through the
            kernel as usual.
          
            In addition, this group include desktop environments such
            as GNOME or KDE. Specifically, using HAL, desktop
            environments may include session-level daemons enforcing
            certain policies when the device database managed by the
            HAL daemon changes. Such policies may include starting a
            photo management application when a camera is plugged in,
            assisting the user in finding driver software and device
            information files for a new device, displaying link status
            information about network devices, mounting removable
            storage and so on.
          
            Note that several desktop sessions may be active on the
            same system; it is the responsibility of session-level
            software to arbitrate the device access between sessions.
          
            Callouts
          
            Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list
            is modified  As such, callouts can be used to maintain
            system-wide policy (that may be specific to the particular
            OS) such as changing permissions on device nodes, updating
            the systemwide /etc/fstab file or
            configuring the networking subsystem.
          
    
      The HAL uses D-BUS to provide a ''network API'' to
      applications. As D-BUS is designed to be language independent,
      potentially many languages / runtime systems will be able to
      easily access the services offered by HAL. The D-BUS API is
      detailed in 
      .
      Note that HAL doesn't
      enforce any policy at all, this is left for desktop environments
      and operating systems vendors to implement.  However, to ensure
      interoperability between operating systems and desktop
      environments, recommendations and best practises on how to
      enforce policy is discussed in 
      .
    HAL on Linux 2.6
      On a Linux 2.6 system HAL is implemented as shown in the diagram
      below:
    
      
    
      Highlights
      
            HAL depends on the udev and
            linux-hotplug packages
          
            The diagram shows an example callout program,
            fstab-sync, that creates/destroys
            mount points and modifies the /etc/fstab
            file accordingly whenever storage devices are added or
            removed.
          
            A session-level daemon, *-volume-manager,
            for mounting storage devices is shown. This piece of software
            depends on a properly updated /etc/fstab
            file and a setuid mount(1) binary that
            allows an unprivileged user to mount devices marked with option
            user in the /etc/fstab file.
          
            The fstab-sync and
            *-volume-manager programs are only
            examples on how to enforce policy and are not part of HAL
            proper.  An OS vendor may choose to enforce policy in a
            different way e.g. he might want to ignore the
            /etc/fstab file and mount storage volumes
            in the callout, run a daemon with sufficient privileges
            or use another setuid mount wrapper.
            See 
            for more details.
          
    Device Objects
      It is important to precisely define the term HAL device
      object. It's actually a bit blurry to define in general, it
      includes what most UNIX-like systems consider first class
      objects when it comes to hardware. In particular, a device
      object should represent the smallest unit of addressable
      hardware. This means there can be a one-to-many relationship
      between a physical device and the device objects exported by
      HAL. Specifically, a multi-function printer, which appear to
      users as a single device may show up as several device
      objects; e.g. one HAL device object for each of the printing,
      scanning, fax and storage interfaces. Conversely, some devices
      may be implemented such that the HAL device object represent
      several functional interfaces. HAL is not concerned with this
      duality of either one-to-many or many-to-one relationships
      between device objects and the actual iron constituting what
      users normally understand as a single piece of hardware;
      a device object represents the smallest addressable unit.
    
      Device objects in HAL are organised on a by-connection basis,
      e.g. for a given device object X it is possible to find the
      device object Y where X is attached to Y. This gives structure
      to the device database of HAL; it is possible to map the
      devices out in a tree. Further, software emulation devices
      exported by a kernel, such as SCSI emulation for USB Storage
      Devices, are also considered device objects in HAL. This
      implies that kernel specific bits leak into the device object
      database. However users of HAL won't notice, such device
      objects are not referenced anywhere in the device objects that
      users are interested in; they are merely used as glue to build
      the device tree.
    
      In addition to provide information about what kind of hardware
      a device object represents (such as a PCI or USB device) and
      how to address it, HAL merges information about the functional
      interfaces the OS kernel provides in order to use the device;
      in most cases this is represented on the device object as a
      string property with the name of the special device file in
      /dev. In addition to the special device
      file, a number of other useful properties are merged. This
      means that both hardware and functional properties are on the
      same device object, which is very useful for an application
      programmer. For example, an application might query HAL for
      the device object that exports the special device file
      /dev/input/mouse2 and learn that this is
      provide by an USB mouse from a certain manufacturer by
      checking the properties that export the USB vendor and product
      identifiers.  See 
      and
      
      for details.
    
      On a formal level, a device object is comprised by
    
          UDI
        
          This is an identifier, the Unique Device Identifer, that is
          unique for a device object - that is, no other device object
          can have the same UDI at the same time.  The UDI is computed
          using bus-specific information and is meant to be unique
          across device insertions and independent of the physical
          port or slot the device may be plugged into.
        
          Properties
        
          Each device object got a set of properties which are
          key/value pairs.  The key is an ASCII string while the value
          can be one of several types
          
                string - UTF8 string
              
                strlist - sorted list with UTF8 strings
              
                int - 32-bit signed integer
              
                uint64 - 64-bit unsigned integer
              
                bool - truth value
              
                double - IEEE754 double precision
                floating point number
              
        
      Properties of a device object carry all the important
      information about a device object. For organisational reasons
      properties are also namespaced using ''.'' as a separator.
    
      It can be useful to classify properties into four groups
    Metadata - Information about how the devices
          are connected with respect to each other
          (parent/child relationships), what kind of
          device it is, what functionality it provides
          etc.
        Facts -
          vendor ID, product ID, disk serial numbers,
          number of buttons on a mouse, formats accepted
          by a mp3 player and so on.
        Usage specific information -
          Network link status, special device file name,
          filesystem mount location etc.
        Policy -
          How the device is to be used be users; usually
          defined by the system administrator.
        
      The first category is determined by HAL, the next is merged
      from either the hardware itself or device information files,
      the third is intercepted by monitoring the operating system
      and the last is merged from files that only the system
      administrator can edit. This specification is concerned with
      precisely defining several properties; see 
      and onwards for more
      information.  As a complement to device properties, HAL also
      provides conditions on HAL device
      objects. Conditions are used to relay events that are
      happening on devices which are not easily expressed in
      properties. This includes events such as ''processor is
      overheating'' or ''block device unmounted''.
    
      There is a special hal device object referred to as the ''root
      computer device object''. This device object represent the
      entire system as a whole and all other devices are either
      directly or indirectly childs of this device object. It has
      the
      UDI /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer.
    
      The fundamental idea about HAL is that all ''interesting''
      information about hardware that a desktop application needs,
      can be obtained by querying HAL. Below is a screenshot of a
      simple device manager application shipped with HAL
      called hal-device-manager.  This
      application is communicating with the HAL daemon and displays
      the tree of device objects. The shown properties are for a
      device object representing a harddisk.
    
      
    
    Device Capabilities
      Mainstream hardware isn't very good at reporting what they are,
      they only report, at best, how to interact with them. This is a
      problem; many devices, such as MP3 players or digital still
      cameras, appear to the operating system as plain USB Mass
      Storage devices when they in fact are a lot more than just
      that. The core of the problem is that without external
      metadata, the operating system and desktop environment will
      present it to the user as just e.g. a mass storage device.
    
      As HAL is concerned with merging of external metadata, through
      e.g. device information files, there needs to be some scheme on
      how to record what the device actually is. This is achieved by
      two textual properties, info.category and
      info.capabilities. The former describes
      what the device is (as a single
      alphanumeric keyword) and the latter describes
      what the device does (as a number of
      alphanumeric keywords separated by whitespace). The keywords
      available for use is defined in this document; we'll refer to
      them in following simply as capabilities.
    
      HAL itself, assigns capabilities on device detection time by
      inspecting the device class (if available, it depends on the
      bus type) and looking at information from the operating system
      (most OS'es have a concept of device classes). At this time the
      category is also determined by selecting the most prominent
      capability. However, both capabilities and category can be
      overridden by either device information files or callouts. This
      gives maximum flexibility, while maintaining a base level of
      capability detection.
    
      The idea of HAL is that existing device capability specific
      libraries (such as libghoto2), would advertise what kind of HAL
      capabilities they are able to handle. As this happens over
      time, this specification will grow to precisely define what a
      device with a given capability is supposed to do and what
      library, or service, the application programmer can use to
      access the device.
    
      Having a capability also means that part of the property
      namespace, prefixed with the capability name, will be populated
      with more specific information about the capability. Indeed,
      some properties may even be required such that applications and
      device libraries have something to expect. For instance, the
      capability for being a MP3 player may require properties
      defining what audio formats the device support, whether it
      support recording of audio, and how to interact with the
      device. For example, the latter may specify ''USB Storage
      Device'' or ''proprietary protocol, use libfooplayer''.
    
      Just as device objects can appear and disappear at any time
      (e.g. when a device is plugged in respectively removed),
      capabilities can also appear and disappear - one example of
      this happening is when device drivers are loaded and unloaded.
    
      Finally, capabilities have an inheritance scheme, e.g. if a device
      has a capability foo.bar, it must also have
      the capability foo.
    Using devices
      While the HAL daemon provides generic operations that apply to
      all devices (though some may be no-ops), HAL is not concerned
      with providing non-generic device operations. Specifically, one
      goal of HAL is to integrate with existing and future libraries
      that target a specific class of devices such as cameras or mp3
      players.
    
      For instance, libgphoto2 could be extended
      such that the application programmer can simply pass the UDI of
      the camera he wishes to interact with
      and libghoto2 would then, via D-BUS, acquire
      the bus-specific information required, the address so to speak,
      from the HAL daemon, and then interact directly with the
      hardware.
    
      Another option is to use the existing API of the device library
      to discover devices (the library would be using HAL under the
      hood) and provide a function to retrieve the HAL UDI of the
      device. When the library is built without HAL support this
      function returns NULL, however, when the UDI
      is available, then applications using the library can use the
      UDI both as stable reference to the device and also to extract
      more information directly from the HAL daemon.
    Device Properties
    Properties are arranged in a namespaces using ''.'' as a separator
    and are key/value pairs. The value may assume different types; currently
    int32, double, bool, UTF8 strings and UTF8 string lists are supported.
    The key of a property is always an ASCII string without any whitespace.
    The properties are updated in real-time.
  Metadata Properties
      The section represents properties that aren't tied to either
      physical or functional characteristics of what the device
      object represents.
    
        info namespace
      
        The info namespace contain properties that
        can be considered metadata about device objects. These
        properties are always available.

      Properties
      In this section properties for device objects that represent
      addressable hardware is described. Availability of
      these depends on the value of the info.subsystem
      property.  These properties are not of particular interest to
      application developers, instead they are useful for libraries
      and userspace drivers that needs to interact with the device
      given a UDI. Knowledge of various subsystem-specific
      technologies is assumed for this section to be useful.

      representing addressable hardware. In most
      circumstances such properties stem from a kernel level
      driver attached to the device represented by the device object,

        storage namespace
      
        This namespace is used to describe storage devices
        and their capabilities. Such device objects will have the
        capability storage and
        they will export the properties below. Note that device
        objects can only have the storage capability
        if they already got capability block and the
        property block.is_volume set to FALSE.
        One significant between the storage and
        block namespace is that the properties
        exported in the storage represents
        constant vital product information, whereas the properties
        in the block namespace represent
        variable system-dependent information.

                optical drives) is used for media with no partition
                table so an entry can be added ahead of media
                insertion time. Note that this is only a hint; media
                may be inserted that has partition tables that the
                kernel may respect. Conversely, when this is FALSE
                media without partition tables may be inserted (an
                example is a Compact Flash card; this media is normally
                formatted with a PC style partition table and a single
                FAT partition. However, it may be formatted with just
                a single FAT partition and no partition table).

                there is no such device (which is TRUE for legacy
                devices such as x86 floppy drives). Additionally, a
                number of properties are merged from that device
                object. Specifically, all properties prefixed
                with storage and, if the

        portable_audio_player namespace
      
        Device objects with the capability
        portable_audio_player represent portable
        audio players that can be attached to a computer to exchange
        files. They can also playback audio. Sometimes they can also
        record audio. This capability can't, in general, be reliably
        probed from the hardware so the information needs to be merged
        from either device information files or callouts. Therefore
        this capability should be merged on the appropriate device
        object that represents the addressable piece of hardware that
        is the portable music player; for USB devices this would be
        the device object representing the appropriate USB
        interface. The following properties are available:

                this tells applications exactly how deep of directory hierarchies
                files should be placed in.  If all files are put in a
                sub-folder (with the audio_folders property), only the depth within
                that sub-folder should be entered here. If the device does not have
                a limit, do not set this property.
              
                portable_audio_player.audio_folders (strlist)

                portable_audio_player.playlist_path (string)
              examples: playlists/%File or Playlist.m3uNo
                Set to the path to which playlists should be written.  Leave
                blank if playlist files are not supported.  If the device supports a single playlist with a specific name/path,
                set this to the path relative to the mount point that it should be saved to.  If it supports multiple
                playlists, use the %File variable as needed.  Applications are responsible for substituting %File with the
                desired playlist file name, noting that it's use in this string is optional.

        camera namespace
      
        Device objects with the capability camera
        represent digital still cameras that can be attached to a
        computer to exchange files. This does not include card readers
        for memory cards used for cameras. This capability can't, in
        general, be reliably probed from the hardware so the
        information needs to be merged from either device information
        files or callouts. Therefore this capability should be merged
        on the appropriate device object that represents the
        addressable piece of hardware that is the digital still
        camera; for USB devices this would be the device object
        representing the appropriate USB interface. The following
        properties are available:
      Key (type)ValuesMandatoryDescription
                camera.access_method (string)
              YesThis property defines how the device is accessed storage
                The device is accessed as a Mass Storage device
                through a kernel driver.  Application Developers
                should descent down the device object tree to find the

              Yes
                The access method to use in scripts, e.g. pmu, toshiba, ibm, sony.
              
                laptop_panel.brightness_in_hardware (bool)
              No
                On some laptops, the brightness control is all done in hardware
                but the hardware also synthesizes keypresses when the
                brightness is changed.
                If this key is set true, then any power manager software should
                not attempt to set any new values on brightness keypress, as it
                may cause the panel to flash uncontrollably.
              
        The following methods exist on the interface
        org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LaptopPanel.
      Method (parameter types)ParametersMandatoryDescription
                SetBrightness (integer)
              
                The hardware brightness state, which should be between 0 and 
                laptop_panel.num_levels - 1.
              No
                This method adjusts the brightness on an laptop screen.
                The values are returned as hardware values rather than
                percentages as we cannot easily to floating point rounding in
                shell code and therefore use the raw values to prevent integer
                rounding errors.
              
                integer GetBrightness (void)
              
                Returns the hardware brightness state, which should be
                between 0 and laptop_panel.num_levels - 1.
              No
                This method gets the hardware brightness of the laptop screen,
                which we may need to do fairly regually on hardware that
                changes the values in hardware without a software event.

        The following methods exist on the interface
        org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.CPUFreq.
      Method (parameter types)ParametersMandatoryDescription
                SetCPUFreqGovernor (string)
              
	        The name of the governor to set. Get a list of available governors
		with the GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors method.
              No
	        Sets a CPU frequency scaling governor for all CPUFreq
		interfaces the kernel provides. If the userspace governor
		is set, this interface also contains a proper scaling
		mechanism. The default performance is set to 50.
              
                SetCPUFreqPerformance (integer)
              
	        The performance between 1 and 100 to set in dynamic scaling modes.
              No
	        Sets the performance of the dynamic scaling mechanism. This method
		summarizes and abstracts all the different settings which can be taken
		for dynamic frequency adjustments, like at which load to switch up
		frequency or how many steps the mechanism should traverse until
		reaching the maximum frequency. The higher the value, the more
		performance you get. Respectively, the higher the value, the sooner
		and the more often the frequency is switched up.
              
                SetCPUFreqConsiderNice (boolean)
              
	        Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU
		load calculation.
              No
	        Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU
		load calculation. If niced processes are considered, they can cause a
		frequency increment although their absolute load percentage wouldn't
		trigger the scaling mechanism to switch up the frequency. The default
		setting is 'false'.
              
                GetCPUFreqGovernor (void)
              
              No
	        Get the current active governor for all CPU frequency interfaces (string).
              
                GetCPUFreqPerformance (void)
              
              No
	        Get the current active performance setting if a dynamic scaling
		mechanism is in use (integer between 1 and 100).
              
                GetCPUFreqConsiderNice (void)
              
              No
	        Returns whether niced processed are considered during CPU load
		calculation or not (returns boolean).
              
                GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors (void)
              
              No

      The properties on a hal device object can be used to express
      certain policies about how the device is to be used. This
      information can be used by either programs querying hal

              Deprecated Properties
      The section represents properties that are deprecated and should be no longer used. 
      The properties/keys will be removed, but not before the date in the following table:
    Key (type)ReplacementRemove (date)Notesinfo.bus (string)info.bus2008-03-01Renamed to something more abstract, available until removed.*.physical_device (string)*.originating_device2008-03-01Renamed to something more abstract, available until removed.power_management.can_suspend_to_ram (bool)power_management.can_suspend2007-05-01power_management.can_suspend_to_disk (bool)power_management.can_hibernate2007-05-01Device Information Files
    Device information files (.fdi files is a
    shorthand) are used to merge arbitrary properties onto device
    objects. The way device information files works is that once all
    device properties are merged onto a device object it is tried
    against the set of installed device information files.  Device
    information files are used for both merging facts and policy
    settings about devices.
  
    Each device information file got a number of
    &#60;match key="some_property"
      [string|int|bool|..]="required_value" &#62;
    
    directives
    that is tested against the properties of the device object. If
    all the match directives passes then the device information can
    include &#60;[merge|append|prepend] key="some_property"
      type="[string|int|bool|..]"&#62;
    
    directives to
    respectively merge new properties or append to existing
    properties on the device object. It's important to emphasize
    that any previously property stemming from device detection can
    be overridden by a device information file.
  
    The &#60;match&#62;,
    &#60;merge&#62;, &#60;append&#62;
    and &#60;prepend&#62; directives always requires
    the key attribute which must be either a
    property name on the device object in question or a path to a
    property on another device object. The latter case is expressed
    either through direct specification of the UDI, such as
    /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer:foo.bar
    or indirect references such as
    @info.parent:baz where the latter means that
    the device object specified by the UDI in the string property
    info.parent should be used to query the
    property baz. It is also possible to use
    multiple indirections, e.g. for a volume on a USB memory stick
    the indirection @block.storage_device:@storage.originating_device:usb.vendor_id
    will reference the usb.vendor_id property
    on the device object representing the USB interface.
  
    When the property to match have been determined a number of
    attributes can be used within the &#60;match&#62;
    tag:
    
          string - match a string property; for example
          &#60;match key="foo.bar" string="baz"&#62;
          will match only if 'foo.bar' is a string property assuming the value 'baz'.
        
          int - match an integer property
        
          uint64 - match property with the 64-bit unsigned type
        
          bool - match a boolean property
        
          double - match a property of type double
        
          exists - used as
          &#60;match key="foo.bar" exists="true"&#62;. Can be used with
          'true' and 'false' respectively to match when a property exists and it doesn't.
        
          empty - can only be used on string or strlist properties
          with 'true' and 'false'.
          The semantics for 'true' is to match only when the string is non-empty.
        
          is_absolute_path - matches only when a string
          property represents an absolute path (the path doesn't have to exist).
          Can be used with 'true' or 'false'.
        
          is_ascii - matches only when a string property
          contain only ASCII characters. Can be used with 'true' or 'false'.
        
          compare_lt - can be used on int, uint64, double
          and string properties to compare with a constant.
          Matches when the given property is less than the given constant
          using the default ordering.
        
          compare_le - like compare_lt
          but matches when less than or equal.
        
          compare_gt - like compare_lt
          but matches when greater than.
        
          compare_ge - like compare_lt
          but matches when greater than or equal.
        
          contains - can only be used with string and
          strlist (string list).
          For a string key this matches when the property contains the given
          (sub-)string. For a string list this match if the given string match
          a item of the list.
        
          contains_ncase - like contains
          but the property and the given key are converted to lowercase before check.
        
    The &#60;merge&#62;, &#60;append&#62;
    and &#60;prepend&#62; directives all require
    the type attribute which specifies what to
    merge. The following values are supported
    
          string - The value is copied to the property. For example
          &#60;merge key="foo.bar" type="string"&#62;baz&#60;/merge&#62;
          will merge the value 'baz' into the property 'foo.bar'.
        
          strlist - For &#60;merge&#62; the value is
          copied to the property and the current property will be overwritten. For
          &#60;append&#62; and &#60;prepend&#62; the
          value is append or prepend to the list as new item.
        
          bool - Can merge the values 'true' or 'false'
        
          int - Merges an integer
        
          uint64 - Merges an unsigned 64-bit integer
        
          double - Merges a double precision floating point number
        
          copy_property - Copies the value of a given
          property - supports paths with direct and indirect UDI's. For example
          &#60;merge key="foo.bar" type="copy_property"&#62;@info.parent:baz.bat&#60;/merge&#62;
          will merge the value of the property baz.bat on the device object with the UDI from
          the property info.parent into the property foo.bar on
          the device object being processed.
        
    The &#60;remove&#62;, directive require only a key and can be used with all keys.
    For strlist there is additionally a special syntax to remove a item from the
    string list. For example to remove item 'bla' from property 'foo.bar':
    &#60;remove key="foo.bar" type="strlist"&#62;bla&#60;/remove&#62;

      Policy settings for devices
      Policy settings specifies system specific settings that a
      system administrator associates with a device instance. In the
      context of hal, this can be expressed in terms of device
      properties merged on the device object in question. Default
      policy can also be merged on the root computer device object.
    Storage Devices
        Policy for storage devices is expressed in the
        storage.policy.default,
        storage.policy and
        volume.policy namespaces, see
        
         for details.
      
        
      Examples and other stuffCallouts
      Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list is
      modified. As such, callouts can be used to maintain system-wide
      policy (that may be specific to the particular OS) such as
      changing permissions on device nodes, updating the systemwide
      /etc/fstab file or configuring the networking
      subsystem.
    
      There are three different classes of callouts. A callout
      involves sequentially invoking all executable programs in the
      string list in listed order.

              is added to the GDL (global device list) but just before it is
              announced through the D-BUS network API.
            
              info.callouts.remove (string list)
            No
              A string list with all programmes/callouts which should be
              executed (with HALD_ACTION=remove) when the
              device is removed from the GDL (global device list). The device
              isn't removed before the last callout has finished.
            
              info.callouts.preprobe (string list)
            No
              A string list with all programmes/callouts which should be
              executed (with HALD_ACTION=preprobe) before
              the device is added to the GDL (global device list) and before
              the callouts from info.callouts.add are executed.
            
      All callouts execute in the same environment as which the HAL
      daemon was started. In addition, the UDI of the device object is
      exported in the environment variable UDI. All
      properties of the device object are exported in the environment
      prefixed with HAL_. If a device is added or
      removed is exported in the environment variable HALD_ACTION
      
      ,if HAL is in shutdown mode the variable 
        HALD_SHUTDOWN
      
      is set to environment.
    
      The HAL daemon isn't suspended while callouts are executing. Thus,
      callouts can communicate with the HAL daemon using the D-BUS network
      API. Hence, one application of callouts is to merge or modify
      properties on a device object.
    D-BUS Network API
      The HAL daemon is a system-wide process that keeps track of a
      number of device objects. It communicates with the operating
      system and intercepts hotplug events as devices are plugged in
      and removed.  The daemon is also responsible for providing
      services to applications that wants to locate devices and
      perform generic operations on them such as obtaining exclusive
      access.  Non-generic operations, such as obtaining pictures from
      a camera device, is outside the scope of the HAL daemon; see
      
       for more information.
    
      HAL has the concept of device stores. When a device is detected
      it is placed in the TDL (temporary device list) and then properties
      are merged from several sources including device information files
      and possibly callouts. Eventually, the device transitions to the
      GDL (global device list) and first then it becomes ''visible'' for
      desktop applications.
    
      Using D-BUS terminology, the HAL daemon provides the D-BUS
      service org.freedesktop.Hal. This service may
      be used to communicate with the HAL daemon, to get or set device
      properties and to perform some action on the devices. In the 
      following sections, this D-BUS interface is expanded.
    
      A C API is provided by the libhal library.
      This API hides most of the D-BUS complexity and presents the D-BUS 
      interface as function call or callbacks.
    Interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager
        The org.freedesktop.Hal D-BUS service
        offers a D-BUS object at a well-known
        location /org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager. This
        object offers a D-BUS
        interface, org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager, for
        querying device objects with the following methods:
      
# Return a list of all devices in the GDL
#
# @return                       List of UDI's
#
array{string} GetAllDevices()
# Determine if a device with a given Unique Device Id exists in the GDL
#
# @param  udi                   Device UDI, for example '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/pci_8086_7111'
# @return                       TRUE iff the device with the given UDI exists
#
bool DeviceExists(string udi)
# Find the set of devices in the GDL that has a given property matching
# a given value
#
# @param  key                   Key, for example 'block.fstype'
# @param  value                 Value, for example 'ext3'
# @return                       Array of UDI's, may be empty
#
array{string} FindDeviceStringMatch(string key, string value)
# Find the set of devices in the GDL that has a given capability
#
# @param  capability            Capability, for example 'volume'
# @return                       Array of UDI's, may be empty
#
array{string} FindDeviceByCapability(string capability)
      
        This object also emits the following signals on the
        /org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager object on the
        org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager interface that
        applications can subscribe to using D-BUS:
      
# Notification that a new device have been added to the GDL
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void DeviceAdded(string udi)
# Notification that a new device have been removed from the GDL. The
# application cannot use this UDI anymore.
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void DeviceRemoved(string udi)
# Notification that a device in the GDL have got a new capability. Note that
# this is emitted even though the device already had the old capability
#
# @param  udi                   Unique Device Id
#
void NewCapability(string udi, string capability)
      Example
          The following brief Python program demonstrates some of the API

        Interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Device
        Applications use
        the org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager interface to
        locate the device objects they are interested in. When a device
        object (which is really a D-BUS object, note that the UDI is the
        objects object_path) is obtained, the HAL daemon provides the
        org.freedesktop.Hal.Device interface on the

      Enforcing Policy
      Notwithstanding the fact that HAL avoids to enforce any policy,
      it is useful to have a minimal set of guidelines such that
      applications using HAL written for one operating system can
      easily run on another. This section contains recommendations
      about how to enforce policy to achieve that goal.
    Storage DevicesPolicy for Volumes and Storage devices
          The properties in the storage.policy,
          volume.policy and
          storage.policy.default namespaces should
          be the preferred way to determine how and if a filesystem
          can be mounted. See 
          for details.
        File systems file
          An operating system vendor should maintain the
          /etc/fstab file through the HAL callout
          mechanism such that device objects of capability
          volume and storage has
          a corresponding entry if applicable cf.
          
          .
        
          The reasoning behind this is, among other things, to
          maintain the invariant that /etc/fstab
          list all available filesystems. In addition
          the mount(1) program should enable users
          without superuser privileges to mount filesystems mentioned
          in the /etc/fstab file as long as they
          have the user option set.
        Disabling policy agents
          Policy agents like volume mounters should ignore when media
          is inserted into a drive that is locked by another
          application. Thus, CD burning applications should lock the
          device to disable auto mounting or automatic start of the
          users preferred CD burning application when respectively
          non-blank rewritable or blank media is inserted.

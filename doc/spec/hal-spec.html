>&#13;	This document concerns the specification of HAL which is a
	piece of software that provides a view of the various hardware
	attached to a system. In addition to this, HAL keeps detailed
	metadata for each piece of hardware and provide hooks such
	that system- and desktop-level software can react to changes
	in the hardware configuration in order to maintain system
	policy.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	A piece of hardware, called a device object in HAL, is
	identified by a unique identifier and a set of key/value pairs
	referered to as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device properties</I
>. Some
	properties are derived from the actual hardware, some are
	merged from <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device information files</I
> and
	some are related to how the device is configured. This
	document specifies the set of properties and gives them
	well-defined meaning. This enable system and desktop level
	components to make a distinction between the different device
	objects and use and configure the devices based on these
	properties.

      </P
><P
>&#13;	
	HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-BUS which is an IPC
	framework that, among other things, provides a system-wide
	message-bus that allows applications to talk to one
	another. Specifically, D-BUS provides asynchronous
	notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the
	message-bus when devices are added and removed as well as when
	properties on a device changes.  

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	The most important goal of HAL is to provide plug-and-play
	facilities for UNIX-like desktops with focus on providing a
	rich and extensible description of what the devices are.  HAL
	has no other major dependencies apart from D-BUS which, given
	sufficient infrastructure, allows it to be implemented on many
	UNIX-like systems. The major focus, initially, is systems
	running the Linux 2.6 series kernels.

> 

          A system-wide daemon that maintains a persistent database of
          device objects. The daemon is also responsible for merging
          information from the device information file repository and
          managing the life cycle of device objects. The HAL daemon
          also contains detection and monitoring code for
          buses (such as PCI and USB buses) and devices (such as
          networking and storage devices). The HAL daemon notifies system
          level components through callouts and session level
          components using the D-BUS interface.

          The term <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>HAL agent</I
> is used to
          characterize programs that is involved in the detection and
          monitoring of devices not supported directly by the HAL
          daemon.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
          Any program can be a HAL agent; all it means is that the
          program communicates with the HAL daemon using a specific
          interface.  Examples of use that come to mind are prototypes
          for supporting vendor or OEM specific buses/devices,
          integration of existing device detection/monitoring
          frameworks etc.

            This represents the end consumers of the HAL and comprises
            both applications that need to search for a device, but
            also (existing) device specific libraries and/or services
            that provide operations on devices. Specifically, the
            application or device library can obtain the ''address''
            (the special device file or other details), of the device
            through HAL to interact with the device through the
            kernel as normal.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
            In addition, this group include desktop environments such
            as GNOME or KDE. Specifically, using HAL, desktop
            environments may include session-level daemons enforcing
            certain policies when the device database managed by the
            HAL daemon changes. Such policies may include starting a
            photo management application when a camera is plugged in,
            assisting the user in finding driver software and device
            information files for a new device, displaying link
            information about network devices, mounting removable
            storage and so on.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
	    Note that several desktop sessions may be active on the
	    same system; it is the responsibility of session-level
	    software to arbitrate between devices.

>Callouts</I
></P
><P
> 

	    Callouts are programs invoked just after the HAL daemon
	    have detected a device, but just before desktop session
	    level applications are notified through the D-BUS
	    interface. As such, callouts can be used to maintain
	    system-wide policy (that may be specific to the particular
	    OS) such as changing permissions on device nodes, updating
	    the systemwide /etc/fstab file or configuring the
	    networking subsystem.

        </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;
      The HAL uses D-BUS to provide a ''network API'' to both desktop
      applications and the aforementioned HAL agents. As D-BUS is
      designed to be language independent, potentially many languages
      / runtime systems will be able to easily access the services
      offered by HAL. The D-BUS API is detailed in
      <A
HREF="#dbus-api"
>the chapter called <I
>D-BUS Network API</I
></A
>.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      Note that HAL doesn't enforce any policy at all, this is left
      for desktop environments and operating systems vendors to
      implement.  However, to ensure interoperability between
      operating systems and desktop environments, recommendations and
      best practises on how to enforce policy is discussed in <A

>Device Objects</H1
><P
>&#13;
	It is important to precisely define the term HAL device
	object. It's actually a bit blurry to define in general, it
	includes what most UNIX-like systems consider first class
	objects when it comes to hardware. In particular, a device
	object should represent the smallest unit of addressable
	hardware. This means there can be a one-to-many relationship
	between a physical device and the device objects exported by
	HAL. Specifically, a multi-function printer, which appear to
	users as a single device may show up as several device
	objects; e.g. one HAL device object for each of the printing,
	scanning, fax and storage interfaces. Conversely, some devices
	may be implemented such that the HAL device object represent
	several functional interfaces. HAL is not concerned with this
	duality of either one-to-many or many-to-one relationships
	between device objects and the actual iron constituting what
	users normally understand as a single piece of hardware;
	a device object represents the smallest addressable unit.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	Device objects in HAL are organised on a by-connection basis,
	e.g. for a given device object X it is possible to find the
	device object Y where X is attached to Y. This gives structure
	to the device database of HAL; it is possible to map the
	devices out in a tree. Further, software emulation devices
	exported by a kernel, such as SCSI emulation for USB Storage
	Devices, are also considered device objects in HAL. This
	implies that kernel specific bits leak into the device object
	database, however users of HAL won't notice, such device
	objects are not referenced anywhere in the device objects that
	users are interested in; they are merely used as glue.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	In addition to provide information about what kind of hardware
	a device object represent (such as a PCI or USB device) and
	how to address it, HAL merges information about the functional
	interfaces the OS kernel provides in order to use the device;
	in most cases this is represented on the device object as a
	string property with the name of the special device file in
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/dev</TT
>. In addition to the special device
	file, a number of other useful properties are merged. This
	means that both hardware and functional properties are on the
	same device object which is very useful for an application
	programmer. For example, an application might query HAL for
	the device object that exports the special device file
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/dev/input/mouse2</TT
> and learn that this is
	provide by an USB mouse from a certain manufacturer by
	checking the properties that export the USB vendor and product
	identifiers.  See <A
HREF="#device-capabilities"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Capabilities</I
></A
> and
	<A
HREF="#device-properties"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Properties</I

          This is an identifier, the Unique Device Identifer, that is
          unique for a device object - that is, no other device object
          can have the same UDI at the same time.  The UDI is computed
          using bus-specific information and it is unique across
          device insertions. It is also independent of the physical
          port or slot the device may be plugged into.

	The first category is determined by HAL, the next is merged
	from either the hardware itself or device information files
	and the last is intercepted by monitoring the operating
	system.  This specification is concerned with precisely
	defining several properties; see <A
HREF="#device-properties"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Properties</I
></A
> and onwards for more
	information.  As a complement to device properties, HAL also
	provides <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>conditions</I
> on HAL device
	objects. Conditions are used to relay events that are
	happening on devices which are not easily expressed in
	properties. This includes events such as ''processor is
	overheating'' or ''block device unmounted''.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	The fundamental idea about HAL is that all ''interesting''
	information about hardware that a desktop application needs,
	can be obtained by querying HAL. Below is a screenshot of a
	simple device manager application shipped with HAL
	called <TT
CLASS="literal"
>hal-device-manager</TT
>.  This
	application is communicating with the HAL daemon and displays
	the tree of device objects. The shown properties are for a
	device object representing a harddisk.

       Mainstream hardware isn't very good at reporting what they are,
       they only report, at best, how to interact with them. This is a
       problem; many devices, such as MP3 players or digital still
       cameras, appear to the operating system as plain USB Mass
       Storage devices when they in fact is a lot more than just
       that. The core of the problem is that without external
       metadata, the operating system and desktop environment will
       present it to the user as just e.g. a mass storage device.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       As HAL is concerned with merging of external metadata, through
       e.g. device information files, there needs to be some scheme on
       how to record what the device actually is. This is achieved by
       two textual properties, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>info.category</TT
> and
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>info.capabilities</TT
>. The former describes

       <I

       alphanumeric keywords separated by whitespace). The keywords

       HAL itself, assigns capabilities on device detection time by
       inspecting the device class (if available, it depends on the
       bus type) and looking at information from the operating system
       (most OS'es has a concept of device classes). At this time the
       category is also determined by selecting the most prominent
       capability. However, both capabilities and category can be
       overridden by either device information files or callouts. This
       gives maximum flexibility, while maintaining a base level of
       capability detection.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       The idea of HAL is that existing device capability specific
       libraries (such as libghoto2), would advertise what kind of HAL
       capabilities they are able to handle. As this happens over
       time, this specification will grow to precisely define what a
       device with a given capability is supposed to do and what
       library, or service, the application programmer can use to
       access the device.
     
     </P
><P
>&#13;
       Having a capability also means that part of the property
       namespace, prefixed with the capability name, will be populated
       with more specific information about the capability. Indeed,
       some properties may even be required such that applications and
       device libraries have something to expect. For instance, the
       capability for being a MP3 player may require properties
       defining what audio formats the device support, whether it
       support recording of audio, and how to interact with
       device. For example, the latter may specify ''USB Storage
       Device'' or ''proprietary protocol, use libfooplayer''.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       Finally, capabilities have an inheritance scheme, e.g. if a device
       has a capability <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo.bar</TT
>, it must also have
       the capability <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo</TT
>.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       The following table define the capabilities exported by HAL
       at the current release:

     As evident, most of the capabilities in the above list is derived
     directly from USB and PCI classes (the careful reader will even
     note that not all classes from the USB and PCI standards are
     mentioned), and as such, are not very interesting to desktop
     applications.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
     However, if HAL becomes adopted by applications, new and
     interesting capabilities (for example <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>pda</I
>,
     <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>camera</I
> or
     <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>handheld_music_player</I
>), based on what the
     device is used for, can begin to appear.

>&#13;
      While the HAL daemon provides generic operations that apply to
      all devices (though some may be no-ops), HAL is not concerned
      with providing non-generic device operations. Specifically, one
      goal of HAL is to integrate with existing and future libraries
      that target a specific class of devices such as cameras or mp3
      players.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      For instance, libgphoto2 could be patched such that the
      application programmer can simply pass the UDI of the camera he
      wishes to interact with and libghoto2 would then, via D-BUS,
      acquire the bus-specific information required, the address so to
      speak, from the HAL daemon, and then interact directly with the
      hardware.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      Another option is to use the existing API of the device library
      to discover devices (the library would be using HAL under the
      hood) and provide a function to retrieve the HAL UDI of the
      device. When the library is built without HAL support this
      function returns <TT
CLASS="literal"
>NULL</TT
>, however, when the UDI
      is available, then applications using the library can use the
      UDI both as stable reference to the device and also to extract
      more information directly from the HAL daemon.

      The info.parent property is very significant - for example, it's
      what allows applications to associate a volume with a
      device. Consider the following setup of devices

      </P
><P
>&#13;        <IMG
SRC="hal-volume-to-device.png">
      </P
><P
>&#13;
      Now, the ''CF Reader'' USB device is an ancestor to the the
      volume that has highlight. Desktop environments can detect this
      by traversing from the volume device through parents to find the
      USB device and either merge more information (such as the
      capability camera) into the USB device object or extract the
      capability (a device information file might have merged the
      capability camera) and act accordingly. Optionally, the DE can
      make the USB device persistent by setting the property
      info.persistent to true.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
      Indeed, this very use-case is one of the reasons that HAL tracks
      information about volumes (FIXME: HAL should, in a later version,
      directly support a property in info. that points to the actual
      device).

      The HAL daemon is a system-wide process that keeps track of a
      number of device objects. It communicates with the operating
      system and intercepts hotplug events as devices are plugged in
      and removed.  The daemon is also responsible for providing
      services to applications that wants to locate devices and
      perform generic operations them such as obtaining exclusive
      access.  Non-generic operations, such as obtaining pictures from
      a camera device, is outside the scope of the HAL daemon; see
      <A
HREF="#using-devices"

>Using devices</I

      HAL has the concept of device stores. When a device is detected
      it is placed in the TDL (temporary device list) and then properties
      are merged from several sources including device information files
      and possibly callouts. Eventually, the device transitions to the
      GDL (global device list) and first then it becomes ''visible'' for 
      desktop applications.

This document is the TODO list for the HAL project. Feel free to add/remove
entries if you get an idea or implement one of the tasks.

 1. Rewrite Linux 2.6 specific parts [in progress, davidz]
    1a. remove all unneccessary references to /proc
    1b. make it easier to add support for new device classes / busses

 2. Generic parts cleanup [in progress, Joe Shaw]
    2a. add callouts - can be used for e.g. updating /etc/fstab
    2b. multiple device stores
    2c. UTF8 support

 3. Persistent device store
    Device should be persistent (e.g. saved in a file) so i) we don't need
    to check fdi files each and every time we start up; and ii) device 
    properties are persistent across time

 4. Property access control and per-user properties
    Non-root users should only have read-access to the devices except
    in properties where the key starts with 'user.'. Also properties
    starting with 'user.' should be per-user (and per-box, e.g. don't
    save them in a dotfile or dotdirectory in the users homedir)

 5. Ethernet monitoring
    Use netlink sockets to monitor the state of network devices.
    Currently mii ethernet registers are used for monitoring but this
    requires root.

 6. Support for signed fdi files
    One way to implement this is using an existing PKI framewore.
    There should be an easy way to sign an .fdi file e.g. a hal-sign-fdi 
    tool. There should also be a directory where vendors can easily 
    drop the public key.

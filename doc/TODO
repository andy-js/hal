This document is the TODO list for the HAL project. Feel free to
add/remove entries if you get an idea or implement one of these. If
you want to work on one of these you might want to send a patch that
updates this file to reflect it.

Ongoing items
-------------
 - valgrind once in a while to fix memory leaks / memory corruption

 - keeping the spec in sync with the code


Small items
-----------

 - Fix doxygen documentation for exported libraries, e.g. libhal and 
   libhal-storage

 - Figure out how to fix configure.in so we can build the spec in build
   systems that are firewalled off the Internet (e.g. replace the URL
   http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd
   with a local path on the system from the installed Docbook packages)

 - Fix storage policy properties now that we have string lists

Medium items
------------

 - Make probers/helpers/addons use a point-to-point connection to hald

 - Support more kind of class/bus devices
   - Bluetooth devices that is connected should appear in sysfs as a
     bus device so the device link from e.g. input or tty abstraction
     should point to the bus device in sysfs

Big items
---------

 - Method invocations - have some way to specify that that a hal device
   object exports the org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Foo.Bar interface -
   suggest to use a property info.interfaces (strlist) with what interfaces
   is supported and set info.interface.Foo.Bar.methodXYZ='/path/to/methodXYZ'
   for all methods on the Foo.Bar interface.
   - Need to define the interfaces and their meaning in the spec

 - Persistent properties, e.g. the ability for someone using libhal to
   say libhal_device_property_set_persistent (udi, "some.property.name") -
   should be a privileged operation

 - Move all privilege checking to D-BUS configuration files - the one shipped
   with hal wouldn't allow much but distributors are free to change this as
   the like (for Fedora we would rely on SELinux probably, Debian would perhaps
   rely on the plugdev group)

 - Privilege separation - discussed here

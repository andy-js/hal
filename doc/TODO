This document is the TODO list for the HAL project. Feel free to add/remove
entries if you get an idea or implement of the tasks.

Must be implemented/work before 0.2 release
-------------------------------------------

 - Fix input hotplug events for input in hald (works in the agent version)

 - Add a device representing the system with properties on kernel name,
   version, xserver version etc. Make all devices that currently doesn't
   have a parent childs of this.

 - Add version number to .fdi XML-file format and check that it's not too
   difficult to extend the format to match on properties on other devices
   (e.g. the root device might have a os.kernel or xserver.version that an
    .fdi file might match different properties for)

 - Port monitoring code from agents/linux26/sysfs/hal_monitor.c to hald

 - Fix Doxygen hierarchy; It's a mess right now

 - Packaging / autoconfiscating; make install/uninstall needs to work on at
   least fedora and debian; It's a mess right now

 - Fix logging system, at least change LOG_[WARNING|ERROR|..] to another
   namespace since it conflicts with syslog.h.

 - Fix memory leaks; especially those when getting strings from D-BUS

 - Add local copy of pci.ids and usb.ids (the location varies on distros)

Other TODO's
------------

 - Add unicode support

 - Port over to use glib in hald where it makes sense (lists, dictionaries
   etc.). Hmm; or use D-BUS support library by copying?

 - Add code/scripts to test

 - Lots of other stuff ;-)
